# Build models -----------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Check assumptions
# [X] y-values are counts
# [X] Counts must be positive integers: 0 or greater (0,1,2,3â€¦k)
range(grid_land$conflict)
# [X] Counts must follow a Poisson distribution
ggplot(grid_land) +
  # geom_density(color = "red", aes(x = conflict))
  geom_density(color = "red", aes(x = log(conflict + 1))) 
# [X] Explanatory variables must be continuous, dichotomous or ordinal

# [X] Observations must be independent

# 2. Build models
# Notes: 
#   - All explanatory variables follow a poisson distribution and should be 
#     logged. This is in part because of the nature of the distribution of 
#     "things". For example, conflict and public goods are bi-products of humans
#     and are expected to exist where people live.

# Hypothesis:
# Areas with a higher investment in public goods (e.g., parks, telecommunication
# infrastructure, roads) and higher financial capital will experience a lower 
# probability of conflict. 

# Table interpretation:
#   - Model interpretation: 
#     + Model 1 is a baseline which only includes control variables
#     + Model 2 adds cellphone towers to the baseline model
#     + Model 3 removes cellphone towers but adds public goods to the baseline
#     + Model 4 includes all variables to account for both communication and  
#       the effect of public goods
