# Areas with a higher investment in public goods (e.g., parks, telecommunication

# Table interpretation:
#   - Model interpretation: 
#     + Model 1 is a baseline which only includes control variables
#     + Model 2 adds cellphone towers to the baseline model
#     + Model 3 removes cellphone towers but adds public goods to the baseline
#     + Model 4 includes all variables to account for both communication and  
#       the effect of public goods
